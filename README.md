Sophie is currently a Clinical Research Coordinator for the PREDiCTOR Study at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. She graduated with Distinction from the University of Michigan in 2025, where she majored in Psychology and minored in Community Action and Social Change (CASC). During her time at Michigan, Sophie worked as a research assistant in Dr. Ethan Kross's Emotion and Self-Control Laboratory, where she researched green space, emotion regulation and social contexts on conflict resolution, among other areas of social psychology. She has also held a research assistant role at NYU's Cognitive Development Laboratory, where she studied children's cognitive development, spanning developmental motivations, stereotypes, and the influence of norms on mental health. Sophie has also worked as an ABA Technician at Mary A. Rackham Institute, providing a more clinical grounding. 

Sophie is especially interested in nature's influence on mental health, such as the effects of green space and the built environment on emotional regulation and  processing. Sophie is further passionate about the implementation of scientific research to produce effective clinical applications, especially for those in need.
