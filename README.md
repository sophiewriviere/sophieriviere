Sophie is currently a Clinical Research Coordinator for the PREDiCTOR Study at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. She graduated with Distinction from the University of Michigan in 2025, where she majored in Psychology and minored in Community Action and Social Change (CASC). During her time at Michigan, Sophie worked as a research assistant in Dr. Ethan Kross's Emotion and Self-Control Laboratory, studying the roles of green space, emotion regulation and social context in conflict resolution, among other areas of social psychology. She also held a research assistant position at NYU's Cognitive Development Laboratory, where she examined children's cognitive development, including developmental motivations, stereotypes, and the influence of norms on mental health. In addition, Sophie worked as an ABA Technician at the Mary A. Rackham Institute, which provided more clinical experience. 

Sophie's primary research interests focus on nature's influence on mental health, particularly the effects of green space and the built environment on emotional regulation and processing. Sophie is also passionate about translating scientific research into effective clinical applications, especially for underserved populations. She plans to pursue a doctoral degree in Clinical Psychology in the future.
